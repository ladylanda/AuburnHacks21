A sequel that exceeds on the first. It retains its action freshness and style, while adding memorable dialogue, a powerful new turn, and a well-made villain. 10/10. this is one of my all-time fav movies. the action is splendid, the character chemistry is very realistic and the sacrifice at the end really brings a tear to your eye. I can't say anything. This is fucking classical aciton movie of all time Despite the utter trash that was dark fate this movie is and will probably always will be the best in this sad and fallen franchise. This film has complex and well-developed characters, excellent action scenes, an iconic soundtrack and a well-crafted screenplay. [----03/23/2021----] Still to this day it's such an inspiring and remarkable piece of filmmaking. Capturing the 90's nostalgia while introducing the technology of the future, T2 is a pleasure to watch as well as the "making of" documentaries. Cameron knows how to make the best sequels, not only by making them bigger and better, but especially by building the story and character arcs exactly how they should be, always pushing the story forward. Who knows how many times I've watched this, or how many times I will again. this movies has so many great things and I can't find 1 bad thing about the movie, it has so many iconic things, has graphics that hold till now, amazing script, amazing actors and acting, good action and more.... Terminator 2: Judgment Day is probably one of the best out of all the series. The Storyline was an ok, not a good but ok. Arnold schwarzenegger plays the Terminator once again and he nails it as always. The only problem I had with this film was the story, but other than that, I loved it! I am going to give Terminator 2: Judgement day a: A- Brilliant. No other words can describe this movie!
